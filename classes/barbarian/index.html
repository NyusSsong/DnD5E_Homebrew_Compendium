<h4 id="level-1-developed-talents">Level 1 - Developed Talents</h4>
<p>Whether in the ruins of an ancient civilization, the barren terrain of the hinterlands, or the back alleys of a prosperous city, Barbarians are adept at surviving and interacting with their environments.</p>
<p>At 1st level you gain a developed talent of your choice. Your developed talents are detailed at the end of the class description. The Developed Talents column of the Barbarian table shows when you learn more developed talents.</p>

<p>Each time you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one of the Savage Exploits you know with another Exploit of your choice, so long as you meet that Exploit's prerequisites.</p>
<h5 id="saving-throws"><strong>Saving Throws</strong></h5>

<h2 id="alternate-path-of-the-battlerager">Alternate Path of the Battlerager</h2>
<p>Reveling in the chaos of battle, the Barbarians of this Primal Path don their signature spiked armor and charge headlong into combat. Learning to channel their Rage while wearing their signature armor, these savage warriors fight as if they have no regard for their own life, only the thrill of battle.</p>
<h3 id="level-3-savage-smith">Level 3 - Savage Smith</h3>
<p>You have learned the skills necessary to craft and maintain your spiked armor. You gain proficiency in smith's tools and heavy armor.</p>
<p>You can also Rage while you are wearing heavy armor.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="level-3-spiked-armor">Level 3 - Spiked Armor</h3>
<p>Over the course of an hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use smith's tools to affix spikes to a set of non-magical armor, turning it into Spiked Armor. Spiked Armor has the following properties when worn by you:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a martial melee weapon with a reach of 5 feet, and on hit, the armor deals piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier.</li>
<li>While you are Raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to make a single Spiked Armor attack.</li>
<li>If you successfully grapple a creature it takes piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="level-6-reckless-abandon">Level 6 - Reckless Abandon</h3>
<p>Your bloodlust propels you into battle. While Raging, the first time you make a Reckless attack on each of your turns you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. These temporary hit points vanish when your Rage ends.</p>
<p>In addition, you can turn magic armor into Spiked Armor.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="level-10-wild-charge">Level 10 - Wild Charge</h3>
<p>Your fury compels you to throw yourself headlong into battle. You learn the <em>Aggressive Sprint</em> exploit if you didn't know it already. While you are Raging, you can use it without expending an Exploit Die. However, the attack that you make as part of this Exploit must be a Spiked Armor attack.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="level-14-spiked-retribution">Level 14 - Spiked Retribution</h3>
<p>When a creature hits you with a melee attack while you are Raging and wearing your Spiked Armor, it instantly takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier.</p>
<p>If you are conscious, you can use your reaction to replace this damage with the damage of a Spiked Armor attack.</p>
