# The Barbarian

For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain.

    #### Level 1 - Developed Talents

    Whether in the ruins of an ancient civilization, the barren terrain of the hinterlands, or the back alleys of a prosperous city, barbarians are adept at surviving and interacting with their environments.

    At 1st level you gain a developed talent of your choice. Your developed talents are detailed at the end of the class description. The Developed Talents column of the Barbarian table shows when you learn more developed talents.

    <hr>

    #### Level 1 - Rage

    You fight with an unchecked primal ferocity in battle. Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to enter a Rage. While your Rage lasts, you gain all the benefits listed below, so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor:

    * You have advantage on any Constitution checks, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws that you make.
    * Whenever you hit with a Strength-based weapon attack you deal a bonus damage of the weapon's type equal to your proficiency bonus.
    * You resist all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
    * You cannot cast spells or concentrate on spells or effects.
    * Your Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, but it ends early if you become unconscious. You can extend your Rage to the end of your next turn by attacking a creature, taking damage, making a Strength check, or using a bonus action to extend it. You can maintain your Rage for up to 1 minute.

    As you gain Barbarian levels, you can Rage additional times between each short or long rest, as shown in the Rages column on the Barbarian table.

    <hr>

    #### Level 1 - Unarmored Defense

    Also at 1st level, so long as you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield with this feature.

    <hr>

    #### Level 2 - Danger Sense

    Starting at 2nd level, you have advantage on your initiative rolls. If you are surprised when you roll initiative you can
    act normally so long as you Rage as part of your first turn.

    <hr>

    #### Level 2 - Reckless Attack

    Also at 2nd level, whenever you make a Strength-based attack on your turn, you can throw aside concern for your defense to make a Reckless Attack. When you do so, you have advantage on all Strength-based attacks and all attack rolls targeting you have advantage until the start of your next turn.

    <hr>

    #### Level 2 - Savage Exploits

    Also at 2nd level, your lust for battle unlocks savage abilities that enhance your martial skill, both on and off the battlefield.

    ##### Exploit Dice

    The Barbarian table shows how many Exploit Dice you have to perform any Exploits you know. Most Exploits require you to expend these Dice in order to use them. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw, and you regain all Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.

    Your Exploit Dice begin as d4s and increase in size as you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Barbarian table.

    ##### Exploits Known

    At 2nd level, you learn two Savage Exploits from the list
    at the end of this class. The Exploits Known column of the Barbarian table shows when you learn additional Exploits.
    To learn an Exploit you must meet any prerequisites that it may have, like a minimum ability score or Barbarian level.

    Each time you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one of the Savage Exploits you know with another Exploit of your choice, so long as you meet that Exploit's prerequisites.

    ##### Saving Throws

    If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

    * **Exploit Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

    <hr>

    #### Level 3 - Versatile Exploration

    Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you learn a new developed talent or replace an existing one, you can instead choose from Fighter soldiering knacks.

    <hr>

    #### Level 3 - Primal Path

    At 3rd level, you choose the Primal Path that best represents your Barbarian's style of combat and the source of your Rage. Your Primal Path grants you features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 6th, 10th, and 14th level in this class.

    <hr>

    #### Level 4 - Ability Score Improvement

    When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

    <hr>

    #### Level 5 - Extra Attack

    Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

    <hr>

    #### Level 5 - Fast Movement

    Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

    <hr>

    #### Level 7 - Feral Instinct

    The primal fury that fuels your Rage in battle also hones your senses. Upon reaching 7th level, you gain the benefits below:

    * Your Rage lasts for its maximum duration, and only ends early if you become unconscious or you choose to end it.
    * You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see (such as traps and spells) so long as you are not, blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
  
    <hr>

    #### Level 9 - Brutal Critical

    Beginning at 9th level, while you are raging, your weapon attacks using Strength score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 and you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit.

    This increases to a critical range of 18-20 and two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

    <hr>

    #### Level 11 - Critical Strike

    You ruthlessly exploit the weakness of your foes. Starting at 11th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack while you are Raging, you can use a Savage Exploit you know as part of that attack without expending an Exploit Die.

    <hr>

    #### Level 11 - Relentless Rage

    The white hot fury of your Rage burns ever brighter. Also at 11th level you gain the following benefits while Raging:

    * If you drop to 0 hit points, but do not die outright, you can choose to end your Rage to make your hit points change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.
    * When you are forced to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

    <hr>

    #### Level 15 - Persistent Rage

    You have mastered your Rage, becoming one with your anger. Beginning at 15th level, when you Rage it lasts for 1 hour.

    <hr>

    #### Level 18 - Reliable Might

    Your physical power and stamina rival the heroes of legend. Starting at 18th level, if you make a Strength or Constitution check and the result of your roll is lower than your Strength score, you can use your Strength score in place of the result.

    <hr>

    #### Level 20 - Primal Champion

    You embody the raw power of the primal wilderness and have exceeded the physical limits of normal mortals. At 20th level, both your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, and your maximum for both of those scores is now 24.

    <div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-ancestral-guardian">

    ## Alternate Path of the Ancestral Guardian

    Not all Barbarians are savages who revel in bloodlust. Some walk a Path of spiritual connection. Those who walk the Path of the Ancestral Guardian form bonds with spirits who have passed from the mortal plane. Some stand as guardians of their ancestral tombs, others channel the power of legendary warriors, and others open themselves up to the power of any local spirit.

    ### Level 3 - Conduit of Spirits

    As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Rage to enter into a state of spiritual ecstasy and give control of your body over the spirits that you commune with. For the next 10 minutes, when you make an ability check that uses your Intelligence or Wisdom, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

    This state of spiritual ecstasy ends early if you enter a Rage, if you fall unconscious, or you use a bonus action on your turn to end it.

    <hr>

    ### Level 3 - Spectral Warriors

    When you Rage, the Spectral Warriors that you commune with come to your aid, and remain with you for the duration of your current Rage.

    Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can send these Spectral Warriors to harry that creature. Until the start of your next turn, the Spectral Warriors swirl around that creature, and it has disadvantage on any attack roll that it makes against targets other than you, and if it hits a creature other than you with an attack, its target has resistance to the damage dealt by that attack.

    These Spiritual Warriors return to you if their target dies, or if your Rage ends.

    <hr>

    ### Level 6 - Spiritual Ward

    You can call on your Spectral Warriors to protect your allies. When another creature that you can see within 30 feet takes damage while you are Raging, you can use a reaction to order your Spectral Warriors to intercept the attack, reducing the triggering damage by three rolls of your Exploit Die.

    If your Spiritual Warriors are currently harrying an enemy when you use this reaction, the effects end for that creature.

    <hr>

    ### Level 10 - Greater Conduit

    Your ability to conduct spiritual power has grown. While you are in a state of ecstasy from Conduit of Spirits, you can cast *clairvoyance* or *commune* without expending a spell slot or material components. However, after you finish casting either of these spells, your state of spiritual ecstasy ends.

    When you cast *clairvoyance* in this way, the spell summons an invisible spirit you are communed with, and when you cast *commune*, you consult your bonded spirits for information.

    <hr>

    ### Level 14 - Vengeful Spirits

    Your powerful connection to the spiritual world allows the long-dead warriors bound to you to once again strike at the living. When you use Spiritual Ward to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to the amount of damage reduced by your Spiritual Ward.

    <hr>

    </div>

    <div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-battlerager">

    ## Alternate Path of the Battlerager

    Reveling in the chaos of battle, the Barbarians of this Primal Path don their signature spiked armor and charge headlong into combat. Learning to channel their Rage while wearing their signature armor, these savage warriors fight as if they have no regard for their own life, only the thrill of battle.

    ### Level 3 - Savage Smith

    You have learned the skills necessary to craft and maintain your spiked armor. You gain proficiency in smith's tools and heavy armor.

    You can also Rage while you are wearing heavy armor.

    <hr>

    ### Level 3 - Spiked Armor

    Over the course of an hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use smith's tools to affix spikes to a set of non-magical armor, turning it into Spiked Armor. Spiked Armor has the following properties when worn by you:

    - It is a martial melee weapon with a reach of 5 feet, and on hit, the armor deals piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier.
    - While you are Raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to make a single Spiked Armor attack.
    - If you successfully grapple a creature it takes piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

    <hr>

    ### Level 6 - Reckless Abandon

    Your bloodlust propels you into battle. While Raging, the first time you make a Reckless attack on each of your turns you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. These temporary hit points vanish when your Rage ends.

    In addition, you can turn magic armor into Spiked Armor.

    <hr>

    ### Level 10 - Wild Charge

    Your fury compels you to throw yourself headlong into battle. You learn the *Aggressive Sprint* exploit if you didn't know it already. While you are Raging, you can use it without expending an Exploit Die. However, the attack that you make as part of this Exploit must be a Spiked Armor attack.

    <hr>

    ### Level 14 - Spiked Retribution

    When a creature hits you with a melee attack while you are Raging and wearing your Spiked Armor, it instantly takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier.

    If you are conscious, you can use your reaction to replace this damage with the damage of a Spiked Armor attack.

    <hr>
