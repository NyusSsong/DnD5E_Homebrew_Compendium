#### Level 1 - Developed Talents

Whether in the ruins of an ancient civilization, the barren terrain of the hinterlands, or the back alleys of a prosperous city, Barbarians are adept at surviving and interacting with their environments.

At 1st level you gain a developed talent of your choice. Your developed talents are detailed at the end of the class description. The Developed Talents column of the Barbarian table shows when you learn more developed talents.

<hr>

#### Level 1 - Rage

You fight with an unchecked primal ferocity in battle. Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to enter a Rage. While your Rage lasts, you gain all the benefits listed below, so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on any Constitution checks, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws that you make.
* Whenever you hit with a Strength-based weapon attack you deal a bonus damage of the weapon's type equal to your proficiency bonus.
* You resist all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* You cannot cast spells or concentrate on spells or effects.
* Your Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, but it ends early if you become unconscious. You can extend your Rage to the end of your next turn by attacking a creature, taking damage, making a Strength check, or using a bonus action to extend it. You can maintain your Rage for up to 1 minute.

As you gain Barbarian levels, you can Rage additional times between each short or long rest, as shown in the Rages column on the Barbarian table.

<hr>

#### Level 1 - Unarmored Defense

Also at 1st level, so long as you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield with this feature.

<hr>

#### Level 2 - Danger Sense

Starting at 2nd level, you have advantage on your initiative rolls. If you are surprised when you roll initiative you can
act normally so long as you Rage as part of your first turn.

<hr>

#### Level 2 - Reckless Attack

Also at 2nd level, whenever you make a Strength-based attack on your turn, you can throw aside concern for your defense to make a Reckless Attack. When you do so, you have advantage on all Strength-based attacks and all attack rolls targeting you have advantage until the start of your next turn.

<hr>

#### Level 2 - Savage Exploits

Also at 2nd level, your lust for battle unlocks savage abilities that enhance your martial skill, both on and off the battlefield.

##### **Exploit Dice**

The Barbarian table shows how many Exploit Dice you have to perform any Exploits you know. Most Exploits require you to expend these Dice in order to use them. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw, and you regain all Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Exploit Dice begin as d4s and increase in size as you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Barbarian table.

##### **Exploits Known**

At 2nd level, you learn two Savage Exploits from the list
at the end of this class. The Exploits Known column of the Barbarian table shows when you learn additional Exploits.
To learn an Exploit you must meet any prerequisites that it may have, like a minimum ability score or Barbarian level.

Each time you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one of the Savage Exploits you know with another Exploit of your choice, so long as you meet that Exploit's prerequisites.

##### **Saving Throws**

If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

* **Exploit Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

<hr>

#### Level 3 - Versatile Exploration

Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you learn a new developed talent or replace an existing one, you can instead choose from Fighter soldiering knacks.

<hr>

#### Level 3 - Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose the Primal Path that best represents your Barbarian's style of combat and the source of your Rage. Your Primal Path grants you features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 6th, 10th, and 14th level in this class.

<hr>

#### Level 4 - Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<hr>

#### Level 5 - Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<hr>

#### Level 5 - Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

<hr>

#### Level 7 - Feral Instinct

The primal fury that fuels your Rage in battle also hones your senses. Upon reaching 7th level, you gain the benefits below:

* Your Rage lasts for its maximum duration, and only ends early if you become unconscious or you choose to end it.
* You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see (such as traps and spells) so long as you are not, blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

<hr>

#### Level 9 - Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, while you are raging, your weapon attacks using Strength score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 and you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit.

This increases to a critical range of 18-20 and two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

<hr>

#### Level 11 - Critical Strike

You ruthlessly exploit the weakness of your foes. Starting at 11th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack while you are raging, you can use a Savage Exploit you know as part of that attack without expending an Exploit Die.

<hr>

#### Level 11 - Relentless Rage

The white hot fury of your Rage burns ever brighter. Also at 11th level you gain the following benefits while raging:

* If you drop to 0 hit points, but do not die outright, you can choose to end your Rage to make your hit points change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.
* When you are forced to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

<hr>

#### Level 15 - Persistent Rage

You have mastered your Rage, becoming one with your anger. Beginning at 15th level, when you Rage it lasts for 1 hour.

<hr>

#### Level 18 - Reliable Might

Your physical power and stamina rival the heroes of legend. Starting at 18th level, if you make a Strength or Constitution check and the result of your roll is lower than your Strength score, you can use your Strength score in place of the result.

<hr>

#### Level 20 - Primal Champion

You embody the raw power of the primal wilderness and have exceeded the physical limits of normal mortals. At 20th level, both your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, and your maximum for both of those scores is now 24.
