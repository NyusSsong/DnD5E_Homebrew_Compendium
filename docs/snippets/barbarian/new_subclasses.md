## Path of the Brute

While most Barbarians hail from the wild places of the world, Brutes discovered their Rage in the underbelly of civilization. Their abilities stem from a combination of street smarts and pure grit. All those who follow this Path share one thing in common, they prefer to solve their problems with their fists.

### Level 3 - The Wrong Crowd

You have a way of falling in with the roughest crowd in any town you find yourself in. When you spend a night carousing in a settlement of any size, you have advantage on all ability checks to gather information on that settlement, its culture, factions, and any important, infamous, or influential figures.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Unarmed & Dangerous

Your body is a deadly weapon. Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

In addition, whenever you take the Attack action while you are Raging and you make only unarmed strikes, grapples, or shove attacks, you can make one additional unarmed strike, grapple, or shove attack as a bonus action on that turn.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Brutal Strikes

While Raging, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to nonmagical attacks. Additionally, you learn the *Concussive Blow* exploit if you didn't know it already.

Also, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can use *Concussive Blow* without expending an Exploit Die.

You can use *Concussive Blow* in this way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Iron Grip

Once you have a hold of something it is nearly impossible for it to escape. While you are Raging, you can grapple creatures up to two sizes larger than you, and your walking speed is no longer halved when you are dragging a grappled creature.

You also gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Brutish Determination

You can shrug off physical blows that would devastate lesser warriors. When you make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or death saving throw, you roll a d4 and add it to your roll.

Should you roll a 20 or higher on a death saving throw, you instantly regain consciousness and stand up with 1 hit point.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="champion">

## Path of the Champion

At the front of every great fighting force stands a Champion. These elite warriors are masters of battle who stand as paragons of honorable combat and fair play. Often, they seek out the most powerful of their foes and look to swiftly end conflicts with honorable duels or athletic competitions.

### Level 3 - Fighting Style

You supplement your Rage with martial training. You learn a Fighting Style from those available to the Fighter. You can't learn a Fighting Style more than once, even if you gain this feature again.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Martial Training

Your combat training has enhanced the potency of your Rage. Your total number of Exploit Dice increases by one. Also, whenever you use a Savage Exploit while Raging, the size of your Exploit Die increases by 1, to a maximum of a d12.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Mighty Blow

You can focus the full might of your Rage into a single mighty blow. When you hit a creature with a Strength-based weapon attack while you are Raging, you can instantly end your Rage and turn that attack into an automatic critical hit.

Once you use this feature you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Peak Athlete

Your physical abilities are peerless. You gain a climbing and swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and when you enter a Rage, you gain the benefits of the Dash action.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Invigorating Critical

A solid strike on a foe renews your will to fight. Whenever you score a critical hit with a Strength-based weapon attack, you can regain hit points equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

<hr>

### Level 14 - Survivor

You are a nearly perfect physical specimen and have become exceedingly hard to kill. Whenever you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="colossus">

## Path of the Colossus

The colossus, sometimes known as a war-hulk, is a barbarian of the front-lines, hefting massive weapons and sweeping away smaller combatants in their fury. To a war-hulk, strength is the only attribute that matters. Cunning is for the weak; faith is for the weak; speed is for the weak. Victory is for the strong alone, and rage is the purest path to strength. This path is a favorite of goliaths and giants, who step easily into crushing smaller opponents.

### Level 3 - Larger Than Life

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you become a titan in your anger. When you begin a rage, your size doubles in all dimensions, and your weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases your size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. This size increase does not stack with similar size increases, such as from the *enlarge/reduce* spell. If there isn’t enough room for you to double your size, you attain the maximum possible size in the space available.

Your weapons also grow to match your new size. While these weapons are enlarged, your attacks with them deal additional damage equal to your Exploit Die. While raging, you can use your action to make a massive swing against all creatures in a 15-foot line within your reach. Roll a separate attack roll for each target in the line.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Imposing Presence

At 6th level, your immense stature can block line of sight. Ranged effects drawing line of sight through your position treat targets behind you as if they have three-quarters cover. When you are raging, this becomes total cover.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Boulder Throw

At 10th level, you can throw massive boulders or other suitably large objects as weapons. Such weapons are considered two-handed, heavy, thrown weapons with a range of 30/60 feet. You have proficiency in such weapons. On a hit, a boulder deals two rolls of your Exploit Die. You can only throw one boulder per turn.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Colossal Strength

At 14th level, your Strength score increases by 2 and your maximum for this score becomes 22. At 20th level, your Strength maximum becomes 26, rather than 24.

When you make a melee weapon attack while raging, the attack has reach if it did not have it before.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="deep">

## Path of the Deep

Encounters with the great and terrible things that dwell deep beneath the waves often irreparably shatter the minds of the weak-willed. However, some who survive these traumatic and otherworldly experiences awaken with an eldritch Rage that is rarely experienced on the material plane.

Those who walk the Path of the Deep are mortals who have survived an experience with the unexplained depths and gained extraordinary, and often unsettling, eldritch abilities.

### Level 3 - Gift of the Depths

You have been irreparably changed by your exposure to the mysterious depths. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and you can breathe both air and water.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Otherworldly Grasp

Your eldritch power becomes apparent when you Rage. Whenever you Rage, you instantly manifest one additional appendage, the appearance of which reflects the nature of the being which infused you with otherworldly eldritch power. Your eldritch appendage lasts for the duration of your Rage, and can be attacked as part of you.

As a bonus action, you can use this appendage to force a target you can see within 15 feet to make a Strength saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failure, it is pulled up to 15 feet toward you. Any target larger than you has advantage on its Strength saving throw.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Reality Warp

Your mind-altering experiences allow you to identify, and slip through, the cracks in reality. As an action, you can teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. This does not provoke opportunity attacks. Immediately before, or after, you do so, you can make one attack as part of the same action.

When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature as part of the bonus action you use to enter a Rage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend an Exploit Die to use this feature again.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Eldritch Tendrils

The strange eldritch power inside you allows your body to mutate further. When you Rage, you manifest two additional appendages which last until the end of your Rage.

As a bonus action, you can cause both of your appendages to use Otherworldly Grasp, or grapple a creature you can see within 15 feet. Each of your appendages can target the same, or different, creatures. If they target the same creature, the target has disadvantage on its saving throw (Otherworldly Grasp) or ability check (grapple). Each appendage can use the same, or a different feature as part of the same bonus action.

When you reach 14th level in this class, the range of your additional appendage abilities increases to 20 feet.

<hr>

### Level 14 - The Horrors Below

When you travel through the cracks in reality, you can reveal the eldritch horrors beyond this world. When you use Reality Warp, you can force creatures within 10 feet of the point you appear to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failure, creatures take psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit die and are frightened of you until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, creatures take half as much psychic damage and are not frightened of you.

Creatures that are immune to the frightened condition automatically succeed on the saving throw and take no psychic damage.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="dreadnought">

## Path of the Dreadnought

Unlike many of their fellows who rely on their instincts and wits to keep them from harm, dreadnoughts have a different philosophy. Clad in the heaviest armor, these barbarians serve as mobile bulwarks, shielding their companions from harm and using their armor and the momentum it grants to fullest effect.

### Level 3 - Leveling Charge

Starting at 3rd level, if you make a successful attack after moving at least 20 feet you can attempt to knock that creature to the ground. The target must make a Strength saving throw against your Exploit Save DC or fall prone.

At 10th level, you can use a bonus action to attempt to knock down a creature that is within your reach that you pass during your Leveling Charge.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Standing Firm

Also at 3rd level, you gain advantage on checks made to avoid being knocked prone. In addition, when a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll if you are wearing heavy armor.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Ever Onwards

Starting at 6th level, very little can keep you from your foes. While you are raging you ignore all movement penalties caused by difficult terrain.

In addition, while raging you gain advantage on saving throws made to resist being charmed or frightened.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Terrifying Inevitability

Beginning at 10th level, your rage exudes such an intense feeling of determination that it fills nearby foes with dread. This aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

While raging you can use a bonus action to choose one creature you can see in your aura and focus your will on it. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

On subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

A creature that successfully resists your Terrifying Inevitability is immune to its effects for 24 hours.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Rebounding Blow

Starting at 14th level, you master your armor to the extent that you can turn a foe’s momentum back upon them. While you are wearing heavy armor and a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to take half of the potential damage and inflict half of the potential damage to your attacker.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="favored">

## Path of the Favored

For most Barbarians, their Rage is drawn from their lust for battle or a desire for revenge, but for others, their Rage is a gift. Warriors who walk the Path of the Favored receive their Rage from an outside source. Some are blessed by Fate to be mighty warriors, others are the scions of gods or Archfey, and others may be the descendants of legendary adventurers.

Whatever the source of your supernatural blessing, you have a knack for finding success when others would surely fail, turning bitter enemies into stout allies, and overcoming obstacles that would seem impossible to all but you.

### Level 3 - Favored Presence

There is something about your physicality that makes others view you more favorably. When you meet a creature for the first time, its starting attitude is one level higher than normal. For example, a hostile creature would view you indifferently, or a creature that would view you indifferently may consider you friendly.

This feature has no effect on those you travel with.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Touched by Fate

An outside force has blessed you to succeed, especially in battle. When you are Raging, you gain the following benefits:

- Whenever you roll a 1 on an Exploit Die, you can roll it again. You must keep the new roll, even if it's another 1.
- When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result of the roll to your Armor Class against the triggering attack.
- When you miss with a Strength-based weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result of your roll to your attack roll for that attack.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Glorious Cause

Your near-supernatural ability to succeed motivates all who follow you into battle. When you Rage, roll an Exploit Die. You, and a number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet, up to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 creature), gain temporary hit points equal to 1 + your Exploit Die roll.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Tireless Hero

Whatever the source of your favor, it has empowered you to find success where others would fail. You also learn the *Feat of Strength* exploit if you didn't know it already. When you use it, you can roll a d4 and add it to your roll instead of expending an Exploit Die. At 14th level in this class, this bonus becomes a d6.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Wondrous Success

You have learned to channel the supernatural power that guides your favored path through life. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to use your Barbarian level in place of the d20 roll. You can use this feature after you roll, but before you know if your ability check, attack roll, or saving throw succeeds or fails.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Strength Overwhelming

You have become something more than mortal, and are able to perform feats of supernatural strength that rival the great heroes of legend. You learn the *Strength of the Colossus* exploit, but it doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known. When you use it, you calculate the base amount of weight you can push, drag, pull, or lift as if you had spent one additional Exploit Die (maximum of 6).

If you already know this Exploit, you learn another Exploit of your choice from those available to the Barbarian.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="fell-blade">

## Path of the Fell-Blade 

Fell-blade barbarians follow the chaos veins that flow through the earth. They let their lives and hearts become one with the fight against the fell-beyonders. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian fuels their ferocity with a quiet rage from the nightmares that live within the earth and turns the nightmares against themselves. Barbarians who draw power from the fell-beyonders have a deeper understanding what lengths a warrior must go to in the defense against the shadow. A fell-blade barbarian wears tokens taken from fallen monsters so that any villain that sees them will know the same fate may very well follow them.

### Level 3 - Fell-Infused Fury

At 3rd level, you unleash the power of the fell with the fury in your soul. When you score a hit with a melee weapon attack while raging, you can choose to channel the power of the fell into your attack. When you do so, the target of your attack takes additional necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

At 6th level, and again at 10th and 14th level, the damage of this feature increases by one roll, to a maximum of four rolls of your Exploit Die at 14th level.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier, and regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Darkest Heart

At 3rd level, the influence of the fell-beyonders can be felt in every fiber of your being. When you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, this influence takes hold until the start of your next turn. While influenced, you can fluently speak the language of the fell-beyonders (Fell-Tongue), but cannot speak in any other language. Additionally, creatures cannot consider you an ally until the influence fades.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Corrupt Fortitude

At 6th level, when you use your Reckless Attack feature while raging, you can choose to not gain advantage on attack rolls from that feature and instead gain temporary hit points equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die. These temporary hit points last until your rage ends.

At 10th level, and again at 14th level, the number of temporary hit points you gain from this feature increases by one roll, to a maximum of four rolls of your Exploit Die at 14th level.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Terror From Beyond

At 10th level, your anger is terrifying to other creatures thanks to your close association with the fell. When you enter a rage, each creature of your choice that you are aware of within 30 ft. of you becomes frightened. As a reaction when it is affected by this feature, a creature can choose to be immune to this effect if it uses its reaction and moves as far away from you at fastest speed by the most direct route.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Fate of the Fell-Touched

At 14th level, your blows can bestow the grim fate of those who oppose the fell-beyonders. When you reduce a creature or object to zero hit points, you can immediately use a bonus action to channel the power of the fell into the target. When you do so, the target’s form is completely obliterated, and cannot be restored or returned to life unless you allow it.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="fin">

## Path of the Fin

Tribal communities exist all across the realms, in all manner of locales and climes. While their customs often change, one steadfast certainty, seen time and time again, is the reverence for particular animals local to that tribe. These are often wildly varied; northern tribes may revere the Wolf or the Bear, those of the deserts follow the Hawk or the Jackal, and those of the jungle may aspire to the Ape or the Tiger. It is in this tradition that the Path of the Fin, island warriors capturing the bloodthirsty essence of the great Shark, arose.

### Level 3 - Aquatic

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you are permanently adapted to life underwater. You can breathe water as well as air and have a swim speed equal to your base movement speed. Additionally, if you are swimming, your rage can’t end early.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Feeding Frenzy

Unlike their land-locked brothers, fin barbarians undergo drastic physical transformations when they enter a rage. At 3rd level, while raging, you sprout rows of razor-sharp shark teeth and gain a melee bite attack. Your bite is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

When you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against that creature. This attack has advantage if the creature has half its hit points or fewer. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Blood Sense

A fully-grown shark can smell a single drop of blood in the water almost a mile away. At 6th level, you gain an amazing sense of smell. You have advantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks dealing with smell, and you can automatically track a single living creature whose scent you are familiar with as long as the trail is less than a week old. By spending a minute concentrating, you can detect the scents of all living creatures in a 100-foot radius, or up to a mile in the water.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Mako

Starting at 10th level, once per turn when you hit a creature with your bite attack, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Exploit Save DC or be knocked prone or grappled by you (your choice). The target has disadvantage on this save if you are swimming.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Tsunami

By 14th level, as a bonus action, you can conjure a magical wave of salt water that rises at your feet and glides beneath you. The wave is up to 15 feet wide and 15 feet tall, and moves with you as you swim. If a creature is caught up in the wave, it is forced to swim and hold its breath until it leaves the wave’s area or the wave moves away from it. The wave extinguishes unprotected flames in its area. The wave lasts for 1 minute, after which it spreads across the ground in all directions and quickly evaporates.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

<hr>
