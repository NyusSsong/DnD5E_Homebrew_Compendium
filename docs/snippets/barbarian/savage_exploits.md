</div>

<div class="exploit-content" data-exploit="exploit_degree4">

#### Devastating Critical
*Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*

As a bonus action you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to enhance your strength to mythic levels, though you must concentrate on this Exploit's effect as if you were concentrating on a spell. For 10 minutes, or until you lose concentration, the amount of weight you can push, drag, pull, or lift is multiplied by the amount in the table below:

| Exploit Dice | Total Weight |
|--------------|--------------|
| 1            | 50 x Strength score |
| 2            | 100 x Strength score |
| 3            | 150 x Strength score |
| 4            | 200 x Strength score |
| 5            | 250 x Strength score |
| 6            | 300 x Strength score |

For each size category you are above Medium, the amount of weight you can move as part of this Exploit is doubled.

For example, a Medium-sized Barbarian with 20 Strength could expend 3 Exploit Dice to use this Exploit, multiplying their 20 Strength by 150, to lift up to 3,000 pounds. If they were Large, they would double this weight to 6,000 pounds.

When this Exploit ends you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer a number of levels of exhaustion equal to the number of Exploit Dice you spent.

While it is charmed, you can use a bonus action to issue it a command, which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action. If it doesn’t receive direction from you, it defends itself to the best of its ability.

Each time the beast takes damage, it repeats the saving throw, ending the effects of this Exploit on a success.

#### Sundering Strike
*Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*

In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike a creation of magical force, such as a prismatic wall, resilient sphere, or forcecage with a melee weapon you are wielding. Any magical creations created with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower are instantly destroyed by your strike.

If the magical creation was created with a spell of 4th-level or higher, make a Strength check. The DC equals 10 + the level of the spell slot used to create it. On a successful check, the magical creation is instantly destroyed by your strike.

#### Unbreakable
*Prerequisites: 13th level, Constitution of 17*

When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, even if that damage would kill you outright, you can spend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and fall to 1 hit point. For each Exploit Die you spent, you roll three Exploit Dice, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.

</div>

<div class="exploit-content" data-exploit="exploit_degree5">

### 5th-Degree Exploits

Exploits of the fifth degree are feats of savage skill that rival those of great monsters. These Exploits can only be learned by Barbarians of 17th level or higher, and each 5th-degree Exploit can only be used once per long rest.

#### Banishing Strike
*Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike with legendary power, dealing bonus force damage equal to four rolls of your Exploit Die. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or be shunted to a harmless demiplane where it is incapacitated. At the start of your next turn it reappears in the unoccupied space nearest to the last space it occupied when you hit it with this attack.

#### Cataclysmic Slam
*Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*

As an action on your turn, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to strike the ground with mythic power. A shockwave of thunderous force erupts from you, forcing all creatures within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take bludgeoning damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent + your Strength modifier and are knocked prone, and on a success, they take half as much damage and don't fall prone. Objects in this area take maximum damage.

The area becomes difficult terrain, and a creature can use its action to clear one 5-foot square of this difficult terrain.

#### Vorpal Critical
*Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*

When you score a critical hit with a melee attack on a creature, you can expend one Exploit Die to strike with brutal legendary force and deal additional damage equal to three rolls of your Exploit Die.

If the damage of this Exploit reduces the target's remaining hit points to 50 or fewer, you instantly cut off one of its heads. If it can't survive without that head, it is killed.

Creatures can use Legendary Resistance to avoid being beheaded. Any creatures that don't have or don't need a head are immune to this Exploit's effects, but still take the additional damage on hit.

## Alternate Path of the Ancestral Guardian

Not all Barbarians are savages who revel in bloodlust. Some walk a Path of spiritual connection. Those who walk the Path of the Ancestral Guardian form bonds with spirits who have passed from the mortal plane. Some stand as guardians of their ancestral tombs, others channel the power of legendary warriors, and others open themselves up to the power of any local spirit.

### Level 3 - Conduit of Spirits

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Rage to enter into a state of spiritual ecstasy and give control of your body over the spirits that you commune with. For the next 10 minutes, when you make an ability check that uses your Intelligence or Wisdom, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

This state of spiritual ecstasy ends early if you enter a Rage, if you fall unconscious, or you use a bonus action on your turn to end it.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Spectral Warriors

When you Rage, the Spectral Warriors that you commune with come to your aid, and remain with you for the duration of your current Rage.

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can send these Spectral Warriors to harry that creature. Until the start of your next turn, the Spectral Warriors swirl around that creature, and it has disadvantage on any attack roll that it makes against targets other than you, and if it hits a creature other than you with an attack, its target has resistance to the damage dealt by that attack.

These Spiritual Warriors return to you if their target dies, or if your Rage ends.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Spiritual Ward

You can call on your Spectral Warriors to protect your allies. When another creature that you can see within 30 feet takes damage while you are Raging, you can use a reaction to order your Spectral Warriors to intercept the attack, reducing the triggering damage by three rolls of your Exploit Die.

If your Spiritual Warriors are currently harrying an enemy when you use this reaction, the effects end for that creature.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Greater Conduit

Your ability to conduct spiritual power has grown. While you are in a state of ecstasy from Conduit of Spirits, you can cast *clairvoyance* or *commune* without expending a spell slot or material components. However, after you finish casting either of these spells, your state of spiritual ecstasy ends.

When you cast *clairvoyance* in this way, the spell summons an invisible spirit you are communed with, and when you cast *commune*, you consult your bonded spirits for information.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Vengeful Spirits

Your powerful connection to the spiritual world allows the long-dead warriors bound to you to once again strike at the living. When you use Spiritual Ward to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to the amount of damage reduced by your Spiritual Ward.
