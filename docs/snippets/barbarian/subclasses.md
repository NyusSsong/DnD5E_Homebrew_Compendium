## Alternate Path of the Battlerager

Reveling in the chaos of battle, the Barbarians of this Primal Path don their signature spiked armor and charge headlong into combat. Learning to channel their Rage while wearing their signature armor, these savage warriors fight as if they have no regard for their own life, only the thrill of battle.

### Level 3 - Savage Smith

You have learned the skills necessary to craft and maintain your spiked armor. You gain proficiency in smith's tools and heavy armor.

You can also Rage while you are wearing heavy armor.

### Level 3 - Spiked Armor

Over the course of an hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use smith's tools to affix spikes to a set of non-magical armor, turning it into Spiked Armor. Spiked Armor has the following properties when worn by you:

- It is a martial melee weapon with a reach of 5 feet, and on hit, the armor deals piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier.
- While you are Raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to make a single Spiked Armor attack.
- If you successfully grapple a creature it takes piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

### Level 6 - Reckless Abandon

Your bloodlust propels you into battle. While Raging, the first time you make a Reckless attack on each of your turns you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. These temporary hit points vanish when your Rage ends.

In addition, you can turn magic armor into Spiked Armor.

### Level 10 - Wild Charge

Your fury compels you to throw yourself headlong into battle. You learn the *Aggressive Sprint* exploit if you didn't know it already. While you are Raging, you can use it without expending an Exploit Die. However, the attack that you make as part of this Exploit must be a Spiked Armor attack.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Spiked Retribution

When a creature hits you with a melee attack while you are Raging and wearing your Spiked Armor, it instantly takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier.

If you are conscious, you can use your reaction to replace this damage with the damage of a Spiked Armor attack.
