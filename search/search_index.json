Some walk a Path of spiritual connection. Those who walk the Path of the Ancestral Guardian form bonds with spirits who have passed from the mortal plane. Some stand as guardians of their ancestral tombs, others channel the power of legendary warriors, and others open themselves up to the power of any local spirit.  ### Level 3 - Conduit of Spirits  As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Rage to enter into a state of spiritual ecstasy and give control of your body over the spirits that you commune with. For the next 10 minutes, when you make an ability check that uses your Intelligence or Wisdom, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).  This state of spiritual ecstasy ends early if you enter a Rage, if you fall unconscious, or you use a bonus action on your turn to end it.    ### Level 3 - Spectral Warriors  When you Rage, the Spectral Warriors that you commune with come to your aid, and remain with you for the duration of your current Rage.  Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can send these Spectral Warriors to harry that creature. Until the start of your next turn, the Spectral Warriors swirl around that creature, and it has disadvantage on any attack roll that it makes against targets other than you, and if it hits a creature other than you with an attack, its target has resistance to the damage dealt by that attack.  These Spiritual Warriors return to you if their target dies, or if your Rage ends.    ### Level 6 - Spiritual Ward  You can call on your Spectral Warriors to protect your allies. When another creature that you can see within 30 feet takes damage while you are raging, you can use a reaction to order your Spectral Warriors to intercept the attack, reducing the triggering damage by three rolls of your Exploit Die.  If your Spiritual Warriors are currently harrying an enemy when you use this reaction, the effects end for that creature.    ### Level 10 - Greater Conduit  Your ability to conduct spiritual power has grown. While you are in a state of ecstasy from Conduit of Spirits, you can cast *clairvoyance* or *commune* without expending a spell slot or material components. However, after you finish casting either of these spells, your state of spiritual ecstasy ends.  When you cast *clairvoyance* in this way, the spell summons an invisible spirit you are communed with, and when you cast *commune*, you consult your bonded spirits for information.    ### Level 14 - Vengeful Spirits  Your powerful connection to the spiritual world allows the long-dead warriors bound to you to once again strike at the living. When you use Spiritual Ward to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to the amount of damage reduced by your Spiritual Ward.     ## Alternate Path of the Battlerager  Reveling in the chaos of battle, the Barbarians of this Primal Path don their signature spiked armor and charge headlong into combat. Learning to channel their Rage while wearing their signature armor, these savage warriors fight as if they have no regard for their own life, only the thrill of battle.  ### Level 3 - Savage Smith  You have learned the skills necessary to craft and maintain your spiked armor. You gain proficiency in smith's tools and heavy armor.  You can also Rage while you are wearing heavy armor.    ### Level 3 - Spiked Armor  Over the course of an hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use smith's tools to affix spikes to a set of non-magical armor, turning it into Spiked Armor. Spiked Armor has the following properties when worn by you:  - It is a martial melee weapon with a reach of 5 feet, and on hit, the armor deals piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier. - While you are raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to make a single Spiked Armor attack. - If you successfully grapple a creature it takes piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.    ### Level 6 - Reckless Abandon  Your bloodlust propels you into battle. While raging, the first time you make a Reckless attack on each of your turns you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. These temporary hit points vanish when your Rage ends.  In addition, you can turn magic armor into Spiked Armor.    ### Level 10 - Wild Charge  Your fury compels you to throw yourself headlong into battle. You learn the *Aggressive Sprint* exploit if you didn't know it already. While you are raging, you can use it without expending an Exploit Die. However, the attack that you make as part of this Exploit must be a Spiked Armor attack.    ### Level 14 - Spiked Retribution  When a creature hits you with a melee attack while you are raging and wearing your Spiked Armor, it instantly takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier.  If you are conscious, you can use your reaction to replace this damage with the damage of a Spiked Armor attack.     ## Alternate Path of the Beast  Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.  ### Level 3 - Bestial Rage  When you Rage, you manifest a portion of your bestial power in the form of one of the natural weapons listed below, which lasts for the duration of that Rage. These weapons all count as simple melee weapons which you are proficient with, and use your Strength modifier for their attack and damage rolls:  - **Bite.** You grow fangs that deal 1d8 piercing damage on hit. Once per turn when you hit a creature with this Bite, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.  - **Claws.** Your hands elongate into savage claws that deal 1d6 slashing damage on hit. Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn and make only Claw attacks, you can make one additional Claw attack as part of that Attack action.  - **Tail.** You sprout a long thick tail that deals 1d8 piercing damage on hit and has the reach property. When a creature within 10 feet that you can see targets you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to add one roll of your Exploit Die to your Armor Class against that attack.    ### Level 6 - Savage Prowess  The ancient curse that flows in your veins greatly increases your physical abilities. You gain the benefits listed below:  - You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. - You learn the *Cunning Instinct* and *Mighty Leap* exploits if you didn't know them already and you can use them at will without expending an Exploit Die (as if you spent 1 Die). - Your natural weapon attacks count as magical for overcoming resistances and immunities to non-magical attacks and damage.    ### Level 10 - Infectious Fury  When you hit a creature with a natural weapon attack while raging, you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC or suffer one of the following effects of your choice:  - The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see. - The target takes 2d12 psychic damage.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all uses each time you finish a long rest.    ### Level 14 - Primal Roar  Your roar is fueled by the primal fury of your curse. You learn the *Roar of Triumph* exploit if you didn't know it already, and you are not limited to using it once per short or long rest, and can use it as long as you have Exploit Dice.  Moreover, while a creature has temporary hit points from *Roar of Triumph* it has advantage on the first melee weapon attack that it makes on each of its turns.     ## Alternate Path of the Berserker  The savage warriors known as Berserkers live for the chaos of battle. For these Barbarians, their Rage is a manifestation of their lust for violence and destruction. Often found on the front lines of battle, Berserkers only feel fully alive when they are risking life and limb to test their might against their foes.  ### Level 3 - Frenzy  Your fury in battle surpasses that of even other Barbarians, making you a terror to behold. The first time you hit with a Strength-based weapon attack on your turn, you deal bonus damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die.  Your fury also propels you headlong into battle. While you are raging, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.    ### Level 6 - Mindless Rage  You lose yourself in your wild Rage. You can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you Rage, the effect is suspended for the duration.  Moreover, while you are raging, you can ignore the effects of the first five levels of exhaustion that you have.    ### Level 10 - Intimidating Presence  Your presence inspires fear. You learn the *Menacing Shout* exploit if you didn't know it already and you can use it without expending an Exploit Die a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.  If you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on the same turn that you use *Menacing Shout*, that creature has disadvantage on its saving throw against it.    ### Level 14 - Unrivaled Fury  The fury you direct at your foes in battle is unrivaled. You learn the *Savage Rebuke* exploit if you didn't know it already and you can use it at will, without expending a Exploit Die.     ## Alternate Path of the Storm Herald  Dwelling in places of great elemental power, Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald come to embody the destructive power of the elements themselves. The primal fury of their Rage turns them into walking disasters; swirling blizzards, devastating hurricanes, and sweltering storms of flame.  ### Level 3 - Storm Aura  When you Rage, you emanate an Aura of primal power in a 10-foot radius, choosing Blizzard, Drought, or Hurricane for its effects. If your Aura requires a creature to make a saving throw, it does so against your Exploit save DC.  When you gain a level in this class, you can change the effect of your Aura for another option from the list below:  - **Blizzard.** Any creature of your choice that starts its turn within range has its speed halved until start of its next turn.  - **Drought.** At the end of each of your turns, creatures of your choice within range take fire damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 damage).  - **Hurricane.** At the end of each of your turns you can force one creature within range to make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes lightning damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die on a failed save, and half as much damage on a success.    ### Level 6 - Elemental Body  Your connection to the forces of nature deepens and grants you the benefits below associated with your Storm Aura:  - **Blizzard.** You gain resistance to cold damage, and when you deal damage with a Savage Exploit, you can choose for it to deal cold damage in place of its normal damage type.  - **Drought.** You gain resistance to fire damage, and you learn the *produce flame* cantrip. Constitution is your spellcasting modifier for it, and you can cast it even while you are raging.  - **Hurricane.** You gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe both air and water.    ### Level 10 - Storm Ward  Your primal power overflows and infuses your companions. While raging, creatures of your choice within your Storm Aura gain the benefits of your Elemental Body feature.    ### Level 14 - Primal Destruction  The elemental forces that fuel your Rage grows ever stronger. Your Storm Aura gains the following additional benefits:  - **Blizzard.** When a creature begins its turn within your Storm Aura, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of its next turn.  - **Drought.** When a creature within your Storm Aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes fire damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die.  - **Hurricane.** When a creature within your Storm Aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is knocked back from you 10 feet in a straight line and falls prone.     ## Alternate Path of the Totem Warrior  Barbarians who follow the Path of the Totem warrior learn to bind themselves to primal bestial spirits of the natural world. Drawing upon this animalistic power, these warriors are able to take on the spiritual and physical abilities of these bestial spirits. Totem Warriors often serve as protectors of the wilds and have a special dedication to the beasts of the wilderness.  ### Level 3 - Spirit Guide  Your connection to the primal spirits of nature allows you to communicate with wild beasts. You learn the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but can only cast them as rituals.    ### Level 3 - Totemic Spirit  Choose one of the animal spirits from the list below to gain its benefits. Once selected, this choice cannot be changed:  - **Bear.** The resilient spirit of the Bear increases your ability to take physical hits. While raging, you gain resistance to all types of damage except psychic damage.  - **Eagle.** The fierce spirit of the Eagle grants you the ability to move fast as the wind. While raging, you can use a bonus action to gain the benefits of the Dash and Disengage action, including the bonus action that you use to enter a Rage.  - **Elk.** The noble spirit of the Elk makes you extraordinarily swift. While raging, your walking speed increases by 15 feet.  - **Tiger.** The ruthless spirit of the Tiger empowers your leaps in battle. You learn the *Mighty Leap* exploit if you didn't know it already. Once per turn while raging, you can use it at its lowest level without expending an Exploit Die.  - **Wolf.** The cunning spirit of the Wolf enhances your ability to fight alongside your pack. While raging, allied creatures of your choice have advantage on any melee attack roll they make against hostile creatures within 10 feet of you.    ### Level 6 - Totemic Aspect  You gain the benefits of a second animal spirit, choosing from the list below. Once selected, this choice cannot be changed:  - **Elephant.** The spirit of the Elephant lends you its power. When you make a Strength (Athletics) or a Wisdom (Insight) check you can add your Constitution modifier to your roll.  - **Owl.** The spirit of the Owl grants you its sight. When you make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check you can add your Constitution modifier to your roll.  - **Panther.** The spirit of the Panther increases your cunning. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) or Wisdom (Survival) check you can add your Constitution modifier to your roll.    ### Level 10 - Spirit Walker  You can turn to your Totem Spirits for spiritual guidance. You learn the *commune with nature* spell, but you can only cast it as a ritual, beseeching your Totem Spirits for information.  Moreover, once per long rest, you can cast *commune with nature* and replace one of your animal Totem Spirits with another animal Totem Spirit available at the same level.    ### Level 14 - Totemic Attunement  You gain the benefits of a final animal spirit, completing your training as a Totem Warrior. Choose from the list below:  - **Lion.** The spirit of the Lion imbues you with regal power. While raging, any hostile creatures within 5 feet of you have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you.  - **Falcon.** The spirit of the Falcon grants you its wings. While raging, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.  - **Rhino.** The spirit of the Rhino lends you its power. While raging, if you hit a creature that is one size larger than you or smaller with a Strength-based melee weapon attack, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.     ## Alternate Path of the Wild Magic  For some Barbarians, their Rage boils up from an unrealized magical potential. When those born with an arcane spark fail to channel it in the correct way, this uncontrollable power can burst forth in a chaotic storm of magic-infused battle fury.  ### Level 3 - Magic Awareness  As an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of spells or magic items within 60 feet that aren't behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn its school of magic.  You can use this feature once per short or long rest at no cost, after which you must expend an Exploit Die to use it.    ### Level 3 - Wild Magic  When you Rage, you roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magic effect you produce.  If a Wild Sorcery effect requires a saving throw, targets make their saving throws against your Exploit save DC.  | d20 | Wild Magic Effect | |:---:|:---:| | 01  | Creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die. You then gain temporary hit points equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die + your level. | | 02  | You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. | | 03  | An orb of wild magic explodes at a point that you can see within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to your Exploit Die. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use a bonus action to cause this effect to happen again. | | 04  | Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that you are holding. Until your current Rage, the weapon's damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the magic weapon leaves your hand, it appears in your hand at the end of your turn. | | 05  | Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before the end of your current Rage, it takes force damage equal to your Exploit Die, as magic lashes out in retribution. | | 06  | Until the end of your current Rage, you are surrounded by multicolored, protective lights; you, and allied creatures within 10 feet of you, all gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. | | 07  | Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you; until the end of your current Rage, the ground within 15 feet of you is considered difficult terrain for creatures of your choice. | | 08  | Roll another d20. On an even roll, your size grows by one category as if by the *enlarge* part of the *enlarge/reduce* spell. On an odd roll, your size is reduced by one category as if by the reduce part of the enlarge/reduce spell. | | 09  | You can't speak for the duration of your current Rage. If you try, a small bird flies out of your mouth and toward the sun. | | 10  | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space. | | 11  | For the duration of your current Rage, you gain resistance to the last instance of damage you took, until you take another instance of damage. For example, if you take fire damage from a red dragon's fire breath, you are resistant to fire damage until you take another type of damage. | | 12  | For the duration of your current Rage, every hair on your body grows by one foot at the end of each of your turns. When your current Rage ends, all of your hair falls out. | | 13  | A bolt of radiant light shoots from your chest. A creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take radiant damage equal to your Exploit Die and be blinded until the start of your next turn. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. | | 14  | For the duration of your current Rage, you can walk through solid objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your movement inside a creature or object, you are instantly shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for each 5 feet that you were forced to travel. | | 15  | Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older. | | 16  | For the duration of your current Rage, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried, instantly bursts into flame. | | 17  | Your limbs grow strangely long. For the duration of your current Rage, the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet. | | 18  | Your muscles are engorged with wild magic. For the duration of your current Rage, all creatures have disadvantage on any saving throws to resist the effects of your Exploits. | | 19  | For the duration of your current Rage, the distance of your long and high jumps is tripled, even if this extra distance would exceed your remaining movement. | | 20  | You instantly regain all expended uses of your Rage. |    ### Level 6 - Sorcerous Infusion  As an action, you can touch a creature, including yourself, and confer one of the following benefits to that creature:  - Choose an ability score. For 10 minutes, when the target makes an ability check or saving throw with that ability score, it gains a bonus to its roll equal to your Exploit Die. - The creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Exploit Die. For as long as the temporary hit points last, the target is immune to Wild Sorcery effects. - You touch a target and expend any number of Exploit Dice. The target regains an expended spell slot of a level equal to the number of Exploit Dice you expend.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses each time you finish a long rest.    ### Level 10 - Unstable Sorcery  Your unpredictable magic lashes out to protect you. When you take damage or fail a saving throw while raging, you can use a reaction to immediately roll on the Wild Magic table.    ### Level 14 - Sorcerous Warrior  Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll twice and choose the magical result that takes place.     ## Alternate Path of the Zealot  Your Rage has been implanted in you by the divine powers of the heavens. Whether you are the descendant of a powerful celestial, or the chosen champion of a deity, you now carry in you a spark of divine wrath. Those who walk the Path of the Zealot stand as champions of the gods and divine causes.  ### Level 3 - Champion of the Gods  You have been chosen for a divine purpose. Spellcasters can cast spells that restore you to life (not undeath) such as *raise dead*, without needing the normal material components.    ### Level 3 - Divine Fury  Your weapon strikes are imbued with the celestial power of the god you serve. While you are raging, the first creature you hit with a weapon attack on each of your turns takes bonus damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).  The type of this bonus damage changes depending on your alignment: Good (radiant), Neutral (thunder), Evil (necrotic).    ### Level 6 - Fanatical Focus  Your divine cause propels you to find success when others would fail. When you fail a saving throw while raging, you can expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your saving throw, possibly turning a failure into a success.    ### Level 10 - Divine Mandate  As a bonus action on your turn, you can issue a divine battle cry to your allies. Up to 10 creatures that can hear you within 60 feet have advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws until the beginning of your next turn.  Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest.    ### Level 14 - Rage Beyond Death  The gods will not allow you to die while you still serve them. Being reduced to 0 hit points while raging doesn\u2019t knock you unconscious. While in this state, you still make death saving throws as normal, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. If you start your turn with three failed death saving throws you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain your Rage.  If your Rage ends and you still have 0 hit points, you fall unconscious. If you have three failed death saves, you die."},{"location":"snippets/barbarian/core_features/","title":"Core features","text":""},{"location":"snippets/barbarian/core_features/#hit-points","title":"Hit Points","text":"<p>Hit Dice: 1d12 per Barbarian level Hit Points at 1st level: 12 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (7) + your Constitution modifier  </p>"},{"location":"snippets/barbarian/core_features/#proficiencies","title":"Proficiencies","text":"<p>Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None  </p> <p>Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution Skills: Two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, Stealth and Survival  </p>"},{"location":"snippets/barbarian/core_features/#equipment","title":"Equipment","text":"<ul> <li>(a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon  </li> <li>(a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon  </li> <li>An explorer's pack and four javelins  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"snippets/barbarian/core_features/#level-1-developed-talents","title":"Level 1 - Developed Talents","text":"<p>Whether in the ruins of an ancient civilization, the barren terrain of the hinterlands, or the back alleys of a prosperous city, Barbarians are adept at surviving and interacting with their environments.</p> <p>At 1st level you gain a developed talent of your choice.

Their abilities stem from a combination of street smarts and pure grit. All those who follow this Path share one thing in common, they prefer to solve their problems with their fists.  ### Level 3 - The Wrong Crowd  You have a way of falling in with the roughest crowd in any town you find yourself in. When you spend a night carousing in a settlement of any size, you have advantage on all ability checks to gather information on that settlement, its culture, factions, and any important, infamous, or influential figures.    ### Level 3 - Unarmed &amp; Dangerous  Your body is a deadly weapon. Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.  In addition, whenever you take the Attack action while you are Raging and you make only unarmed strikes, grapples, or shove attacks, you can make one additional unarmed strike, grapple, or shove attack as a bonus action on that turn.    ### Level 6 - Brutal Strikes  While Raging, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to nonmagical attacks. Additionally, you learn the *Concussive Blow* exploit if you didn't know it already.  Also, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can use *Concussive Blow* without expending an Exploit Die.  You can use *Concussive Blow* in this way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.    ### Level 10 - Iron Grip  Once you have a hold of something it is nearly impossible for it to escape. While you are Raging, you can grapple creatures up to two sizes larger than you, and your walking speed is no longer halved when you are dragging a grappled creature.  You also gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed.    ### Level 14 - Brutish Determination  You can shrug off physical blows that would devastate lesser warriors. When you make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or death saving throw, you roll a d4 and add it to your roll.  Should you roll a 20 or higher on a death saving throw, you instantly regain consciousness and stand up with 1 hit point.     ## Path of the Champion  At the front of every great fighting force stands a Champion. These elite warriors are masters of battle who stand as paragons of honorable combat and fair play. Often, they seek out the most powerful of their foes and look to swiftly end conflicts with honorable duels or athletic competitions.  ### Level 3 - Fighting Style  You supplement your Rage with martial training. You learn a Fighting Style from those available to the Fighter. You can't learn a Fighting Style more than once, even if you gain this feature again.    ### Level 3 - Martial Training  Your combat training has enhanced the potency of your Rage. Your total number of Exploit Dice increases by one. Also, whenever you use a Savage Exploit while Raging, the size of your Exploit Die increases by 1, to a maximum of a d12.    ### Level 6 - Mighty Blow  You can focus the full might of your Rage into a single mighty blow. When you hit a creature with a Strength-based weapon attack while you are Raging, you can instantly end your Rage and turn that attack into an automatic critical hit.  Once you use this feature you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.    ### Level 6 - Peak Athlete  Your physical abilities are peerless. You gain a climbing and swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and when you enter a Rage, you gain the benefits of the Dash action.    ### Level 10 - Invigorating Critical  A solid strike on a foe renews your will to fight. Whenever you score a critical hit with a Strength-based weapon attack, you can regain hit points equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).    ### Level 14 - Survivor  You are a nearly perfect physical specimen and have become exceedingly hard to kill. Whenever you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).     ## Path of the Colossus  The colossus, sometimes known as a war-hulk, is a barbarian of the front-lines, hefting massive weapons and sweeping away smaller combatants in their fury. To a war-hulk, strength is the only attribute that matters. Cunning is for the weak; faith is for the weak; speed is for the weak. Victory is for the strong alone, and rage is the purest path to strength. This path is a favorite of goliaths and giants, who step easily into crushing smaller opponents.  ### Level 3 - Larger Than Life  Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you become a titan in your anger. When you begin a rage, your size doubles in all dimensions, and your weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases your size by one category\u2014from Medium to Large, for example. This size increase does not stack with similar size increases, such as from the *enlarge/reduce* spell. If there isn\u2019t enough room for you to double your size, you attain the maximum possible size in the space available.  Your weapons also grow to match your new size. While these weapons are enlarged, your attacks with them deal additional damage equal to your Exploit Die. While raging, you can use your action to make a massive swing against all creatures in a 15-foot line within your reach. Roll a separate attack roll for each target in the line.    ### Level 6 - Imposing Presence  At 6th level, your immense stature can block line of sight. Ranged effects drawing line of sight through your position treat targets behind you as if they have three-quarters cover. When you are raging, this becomes total cover.    ### Level 10 - Boulder Throw  At 10th level, you can throw massive boulders or other suitably large objects as weapons. Such weapons are considered two-handed, heavy, thrown weapons with a range of 30/60 feet. You have proficiency in such weapons. On a hit, a boulder deals two rolls of your Exploit Die. You can only throw one boulder per turn.    ### Level 14 - Colossal Strength  At 14th level, your Strength score increases by 2 and your maximum for this score becomes 22. At 20th level, your Strength maximum becomes 26, rather than 24.  When you make a melee weapon attack while raging, the attack has reach if it did not have it before.     ## Path of the Deep  Encounters with the great and terrible things that dwell deep beneath the waves often irreparably shatter the minds of the weak-willed. However, some who survive these traumatic and otherworldly experiences awaken with an eldritch Rage that is rarely experienced on the material plane.  Those who walk the Path of the Deep are mortals who have survived an experience with the unexplained depths and gained extraordinary, and often unsettling, eldritch abilities.  ### Level 3 - Gift of the Depths  You have been irreparably changed by your exposure to the mysterious depths. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and you can breathe both air and water.    ### Level 3 - Otherworldly Grasp  Your eldritch power becomes apparent when you Rage. Whenever you Rage, you instantly manifest one additional appendage, the appearance of which reflects the nature of the being which infused you with otherworldly eldritch power. Your eldritch appendage lasts for the duration of your Rage, and can be attacked as part of you.  As a bonus action, you can use this appendage to force a target you can see within 15 feet to make a Strength saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failure, it is pulled up to 15 feet toward you. Any target larger than you has advantage on its Strength saving throw.    ### Level 6 - Reality Warp  Your mind-altering experiences allow you to identify, and slip through, the cracks in reality. As an action, you can teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. This does not provoke opportunity attacks. Immediately before, or after, you do so, you can make one attack as part of the same action.  When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature as part of the bonus action you use to enter a Rage.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend an Exploit Die to use this feature again.    ### Level 10 - Eldritch Tendrils  The strange eldritch power inside you allows your body to mutate further. When you Rage, you manifest two additional appendages which last until the end of your Rage.  As a bonus action, you can cause both of your appendages to use Otherworldly Grasp, or grapple a creature you can see within 15 feet. Each of your appendages can target the same, or different, creatures. If they target the same creature, the target has disadvantage on its saving throw (Otherworldly Grasp) or ability check (grapple). Each appendage can use the same, or a different feature as part of the same bonus action.  When you reach 14th level in this class, the range of your additional appendage abilities increases to 20 feet.    ### Level 14 - The Horrors Below  When you travel through the cracks in reality, you can reveal the eldritch horrors beyond this world. When you use Reality Warp, you can force creatures within 10 feet of the point you appear to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failure, creatures take psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit die and are frightened of you until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, creatures take half as much psychic damage and are not frightened of you.  Creatures that are immune to the frightened condition automatically succeed on the saving throw and take no psychic damage.     ## Path of the Dreadnought  Unlike many of their fellows who rely on their instincts and wits to keep them from harm, dreadnoughts have a different philosophy. Clad in the heaviest armor, these barbarians serve as mobile bulwarks, shielding their companions from harm and using their armor and the momentum it grants to fullest effect.  ### Level 3 - Leveling Charge  Starting at 3rd level, if you make a successful attack after moving at least 20 feet you can attempt to knock that creature to the ground. The target must make a Strength saving throw against your Exploit Save DC or fall prone.  At 10th level, you can use a bonus action to attempt to knock down a creature that is within your reach that you pass during your Leveling Charge.    ### Level 3 - Standing Firm  Also at 3rd level, you gain advantage on checks made to avoid being knocked prone. In addition, when a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll if you are wearing heavy armor.    ### Level 6 - Ever Onwards  Starting at 6th level, very little can keep you from your foes. While you are raging you ignore all movement penalties caused by difficult terrain.  In addition, while raging you gain advantage on saving throws made to resist being charmed or frightened.    ### Level 10 - Terrifying Inevitability  Beginning at 10th level, your rage exudes such an intense feeling of determination that it fills nearby foes with dread. This aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.  While raging you can use a bonus action to choose one creature you can see in your aura and focus your will on it. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.  On subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.  A creature that successfully resists your Terrifying Inevitability is immune to its effects for 24 hours.    ### Level 14 - Rebounding Blow  Starting at 14th level, you master your armor to the extent that you can turn a foe\u2019s momentum back upon them. While you are wearing heavy armor and a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to take half of the potential damage and inflict half of the potential damage to your attacker.     ## Path of the Favored  For most Barbarians, their Rage is drawn from their lust for battle or a desire for revenge, but for others, their Rage is a gift. Warriors who walk the Path of the Favored receive their Rage from an outside source. Some are blessed by Fate to be mighty warriors, others are the scions of gods or Archfey, and others may be the descendants of legendary adventurers.  Whatever the source of your supernatural blessing, you have a knack for finding success when others would surely fail, turning bitter enemies into stout allies, and overcoming obstacles that would seem impossible to all but you.  ### Level 3 - Favored Presence  There is something about your physicality that makes others view you more favorably. When you meet a creature for the first time, its starting attitude is one level higher than normal. For example, a hostile creature would view you indifferently, or a creature that would view you indifferently may consider you friendly.  This feature has no effect on those you travel with.    ### Level 3 - Touched by Fate  An outside force has blessed you to succeed, especially in battle. When you are Raging, you gain the following benefits:  - Whenever you roll a 1 on an Exploit Die, you can roll it again. You must keep the new roll, even if it's another 1. - When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result of the roll to your Armor Class against the triggering attack. - When you miss with a Strength-based weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result of your roll to your attack roll for that attack.    ### Level 6 - Glorious Cause  Your near-supernatural ability to succeed motivates all who follow you into battle. When you Rage, roll an Exploit Die. You, and a number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet, up to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 creature), gain temporary hit points equal to 1 + your Exploit Die roll.    ### Level 6 - Tireless Hero  Whatever the source of your favor, it has empowered you to find success where others would fail. You also learn the *Feat of Strength* exploit if you didn't know it already. When you use it, you can roll a d4 and add it to your roll instead of expending an Exploit Die. At 14th level in this class, this bonus becomes a d6.    ### Level 10 - Wondrous Success  You have learned to channel the supernatural power that guides your favored path through life. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to use your Barbarian level in place of the d20 roll. You can use this feature after you roll, but before you know if your ability check, attack roll, or saving throw succeeds or fails.  Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.    ### Level 14 - Strength Overwhelming  You have become something more than mortal, and are able to perform feats of supernatural strength that rival the great heroes of legend. You learn the *Strength of the Colossus* exploit, but it doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known. When you use it, you calculate the base amount of weight you can push, drag, pull, or lift as if you had spent one additional Exploit Die (maximum of 6).  If you already know this Exploit, you learn another Exploit of your choice from those available to the Barbarian.     ## Path of the Fell-Blade   Fell-blade barbarians follow the chaos veins that flow through the earth. They let their lives and hearts become one with the fight against the fell-beyonders. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian fuels their ferocity with a quiet rage from the nightmares that live within the earth and turns the nightmares against themselves. Barbarians who draw power from the fell-beyonders have a deeper understanding what lengths a warrior must go to in the defense against the shadow. A fell-blade barbarian wears tokens taken from fallen monsters so that any villain that sees them will know the same fate may very well follow them.  ### Level 3 - Fell-Infused Fury  At 3rd level, you unleash the power of the fell with the fury in your soul. When you score a hit with a melee weapon attack while raging, you can choose to channel the power of the fell into your attack. When you do so, the target of your attack takes additional necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.  At 6th level, and again at 10th and 14th level, the damage of this feature increases by one roll, to a maximum of four rolls of your Exploit Die at 14th level.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier, and regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.    ### Level 3 - Darkest Heart  At 3rd level, the influence of the fell-beyonders can be felt in every fiber of your being. When you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, this influence takes hold until the start of your next turn. While influenced, you can fluently speak the language of the fell-beyonders (Fell-Tongue), but cannot speak in any other language. Additionally, creatures cannot consider you an ally until the influence fades.    ### Level 6 - Corrupt Fortitude  At 6th level, when you use your Reckless Attack feature while raging, you can choose to not gain advantage on attack rolls from that feature and instead gain temporary hit points equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die. These temporary hit points last until your rage ends.  At 10th level, and again at 14th level, the number of temporary hit points you gain from this feature increases by one roll, to a maximum of four rolls of your Exploit Die at 14th level.    ### Level 10 - Terror From Beyond  At 10th level, your anger is terrifying to other creatures thanks to your close association with the fell. When you enter a rage, each creature of your choice that you are aware of within 30 ft. of you becomes frightened. As a reaction when it is affected by this feature, a creature can choose to be immune to this effect if it uses its reaction and moves as far away from you at fastest speed by the most direct route.    ### Level 14 - Fate of the Fell-Touched  At 14th level, your blows can bestow the grim fate of those who oppose the fell-beyonders. When you reduce a creature or object to zero hit points, you can immediately use a bonus action to channel the power of the fell into the target. When you do so, the target\u2019s form is completely obliterated, and cannot be restored or returned to life unless you allow it.     ## Path of the Fin  Tribal communities exist all across the realms, in all manner of locales and climes. While their customs often change, one steadfast certainty, seen time and time again, is the reverence for particular animals local to that tribe. These are often wildly varied; northern tribes may revere the Wolf or the Bear, those of the deserts follow the Hawk or the Jackal, and those of the jungle may aspire to the Ape or the Tiger. It is in this tradition that the Path of the Fin, island warriors capturing the bloodthirsty essence of the great Shark, arose.  ### Level 3 - Aquatic  Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you are permanently adapted to life underwater. You can breathe water as well as air and have a swim speed equal to your base movement speed. Additionally, if you are swimming, your rage can\u2019t end early.    ### Level 3 - Feeding Frenzy  Unlike their land-locked brothers, fin barbarians undergo drastic physical transformations when they enter a rage. At 3rd level, while raging, you sprout rows of razor-sharp shark teeth and gain a melee bite attack. Your bite is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.  When you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against that creature. This attack has advantage if the creature has half its hit points or fewer. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.    ### Level 6 - Blood Sense  A fully-grown shark can smell a single drop of blood in the water almost a mile away. At 6th level, you gain an amazing sense of smell. You have advantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks dealing with smell, and you can automatically track a single living creature whose scent you are familiar with as long as the trail is less than a week old. By spending a minute concentrating, you can detect the scents of all living creatures in a 100-foot radius, or up to a mile in the water.    ### Level 10 - Mako  Starting at 10th level, once per turn when you hit a creature with your bite attack, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Exploit Save DC or be knocked prone or grappled by you (your choice). The target has disadvantage on this save if you are swimming.    ### Level 14 - Tsunami  By 14th level, as a bonus action, you can conjure a magical wave of salt water that rises at your feet and glides beneath you. The wave is up to 15 feet wide and 15 feet tall, and moves with you as you swim. If a creature is caught up in the wave, it is forced to swim and hold its breath until it leaves the wave\u2019s area or the wave moves away from it. The wave extinguishes unprotected flames in its area. The wave lasts for 1 minute, after which it spreads across the ground in all directions and quickly evaporates.  Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a short or long rest."},{"location":"snippets/barbarian/progression/","title":"Progression","text":"Level PB Features Rages Developed Talents Exploits Known Exploit Die Exploit Dice 1st +2 Developed Talents, Rage, Unarmored Defense 2 1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2nd +2 Danger Sense, Reckless Attack, Savage Exploits 2 1 2 d4 2 3rd +2 Versatile Exploration, Primal Path 3 1 2 d4 2 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 1 3 d4 2 5th +3 Extra Attack, Fast Movement 3 2 3 d6 3 6th +3 Primal Path Feature 4 2 4 d6 3 7th +3 Feral Instincts 4 2 4 d6 3 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 2 5 d6 3 9th +4 Brutal Critical (19, 1 dice) 4 3 5 d6 3 10th +4 Primal Path Feature 4 3 6 d6 3 11th +4 Critical Strike, Relentless Rage 4 3 6 d8 4 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 3 6 d8 4 13th +5 Brutal Critical (18, 2 dice) 5 4 7 d8 4 14th +5 Path Feature 5 4 7 d8 4 15th +5 Persistent Rage 5 4 7 d8 4 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 6 4 7 d8 4 17th +6 Brutal Critical (3 dice) 6 5 8 d10 5 18th +6 Indomitable Might 6 5 8 d10 5 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 6 5 8 d10 5 20th +6 Paragon of Rage Unlimited 5 8 d10 5"},{"location":"snippets/barbarian/savage_exploits/","title":"Savage exploits","text":"<p>Choose an exploit degree:</p> <p> All Degree 1 Exploits Degree 2 Exploits Degree 3 Exploits Degree 4 Exploits Degree 5 Exploits <p></p>   ### 1st-Degree Exploits  Exploits of the 1st-degree are minor techniques slightly more complicated than swinging a weapon.

If it hits another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier.

This effect ends early if you attack a creature other than the target.  #### Immovable Stance *Prerequisites: 5th level, Strength or Constitution of 13*  As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to enter an immovable stance that lasts until you move from the space.

If the total rolled exceeds the amount of damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to the remaining amount.  #### Pack Tactics *Prerequisites: 9th level, Wisdom of 15*  As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die to signal your allies to fight as a pack. Until the end of your next turn, creatures of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet have advantage on attack rolls, so long as a conscious allied creature is within 5 feet of their target.  You can use a bonus action on your next turn to extend the effects of this Exploit to the end of the turn after that, though you do not need to expend an Exploit Die when you do so.  You cannot maintain this Exploit longer than 1 minute.  #### Primal Terror *Prerequisite: 9th level*  As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die to attempt to drive a creature within 5 feet into a fit of primal fear, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures as enemies for the next minute. Each time it takes damage, it repeats the saving throw, ending this effect on a success.  Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target of an attack or spell, it must choose its target at random from among the creatures it can see within range.  If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, it must make that attack if it is able to.  #### Roar of Triumph *Prerequisites: 9th level*  When you score a critical hit, you can expend an Exploit Die to let out a cry that can be heard up to 300 feet away. You and a number of creatures of your choice who can hear you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier.  #### Savage Defiance *Prerequisites: 9th level*  As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die to issue a savage challenge.

Once you use this Exploit to survey an area of wilderness you must finish a long rest before you can use it there again.  #### War Cry *Prerequisites: 9th level*  As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and issue a mighty cry, forcing creatures of your choice that can hear you in an adjacent 30-foot cone to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they drop whatever they are holding and are frightened of you for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn and does not have line of sight to you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.     ### 4th-Degree Exploits  Exploits of this degree can only be learned by Barbarians of 13th level or higher, and each 4th-degree Exploit that you know can only be used once per short or long rest.  #### Devastating Critical *Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*  When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to shatter its focus. If it was concentrating on a spell or effect, it automatically loses concentration, and for 1 minute, it has disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, and any saving throws it makes to maintain concentration.  The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.  ### Staggering Blow *#Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*  When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike with near-supernatural power, dealing additional damage equal to three rolls of your Exploit Die. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or for the next minute it has disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls and it cannot take reactions.  The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending these effects on a success.  #### Strength of the Colossus *Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*  As a bonus action you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to enhance your strength to mythic levels, though you must concentrate on this Exploit's effect as if you were concentrating on a spell. For 10 minutes, or until you lose concentration, the amount of weight you can push, drag, pull, or lift is multiplied by the amount in the table below:  | Exploit Dice | Total Weight | |--------------|--------------| | 1            | 50 x Strength score | | 2            | 100 x Strength score | | 3            | 150 x Strength score | | 4            | 200 x Strength score | | 5            | 250 x Strength score | | 6            | 300 x Strength score |  For each size category you are above Medium, the amount of weight you can move as part of this Exploit is doubled.  For example, a Medium-sized Barbarian with 20 Strength could expend 3 Exploit Dice to use this Exploit, multiplying their 20 Strength by 150, to lift up to 3,000 pounds. If they were Large, they would double this weight to 6,000 pounds.  When this Exploit ends you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer a number of levels of exhaustion equal to the number of Exploit Dice you spent.  #### Subjugate Beast *Prerequisites: 13th level*  As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and attempt to intimidate one beast that can see or hear you within 30 feet, bending it to your will. The beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be considered charmed by you for 1 minute.  While it is charmed, you can use a bonus action to issue it a command, which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action. If it doesn\u2019t receive direction from you, it defends itself to the best of its ability.  Each time the beast takes damage, it repeats the saving throw, ending the effects of this Exploit on a success.  #### Sundering Strike *Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*  In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike a creation of magical force, such as a prismatic wall, resilient sphere, or forcecage with a melee weapon you are wielding. Any magical creations created with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower are instantly destroyed by your strike.  If the magical creation was created with a spell of 4th-level or higher, make a Strength check. The DC equals 10 + the level of the spell slot used to create it. On a successful check, the magical creation is instantly destroyed by your strike.  #### Unbreakable *Prerequisites: 13th level, Constitution of 17*  When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, even if that damage would kill you outright, you can spend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and fall to 1 hit point. For each Exploit Die you spent, you roll three Exploit Dice, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.     ### 5th-Degree Exploits  Exploits of the fifth degree are feats of savage skill that rival those of great monsters. These Exploits can only be learned by Barbarians of 17th level or higher, and each 5th-degree Exploit can only be used once per long rest.  #### Banishing Strike *Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*  When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike with legendary power, dealing bonus force damage equal to four rolls of your Exploit Die. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or be shunted to a harmless demiplane where it is incapacitated. At the start of your next turn it reappears in the unoccupied space nearest to the last space it occupied when you hit it with this attack.  #### Cataclysmic Slam *Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*  As an action on your turn, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to strike the ground with mythic power. A shockwave of thunderous force erupts from you, forcing all creatures within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take bludgeoning damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent + your Strength modifier and are knocked prone, and on a success, they take half as much damage and don't fall prone. Objects in this area take maximum damage.  The area becomes difficult terrain, and a creature can use its action to clear one 5-foot square of this difficult terrain.  #### Vorpal Critical *Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*  When you score a critical hit with a melee attack on a creature, you can expend one Exploit Die to strike with brutal legendary force and deal additional damage equal to three rolls of your Exploit Die.  If the damage of this Exploit reduces the target's remaining hit points to 50 or fewer, you instantly cut off one of its heads. If it can't survive without that head, it is killed.  Creatures can use Legendary Resistance to avoid being beheaded. Any creatures that don't have or don't need a head are immune to this Exploit's effects, but still take the additional damage on hit."}]}
