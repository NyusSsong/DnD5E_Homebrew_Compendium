## Alternate Path of the Ancestral Guardian

Not all Barbarians are savages who revel in bloodlust. Some walk a Path of spiritual connection. Those who walk the Path of the Ancestral Guardian form bonds with spirits who have passed from the mortal plane. Some stand as guardians of their ancestral tombs, others channel the power of legendary warriors, and others open themselves up to the power of any local spirit.

### Level 3 - Conduit of Spirits

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Rage to enter into a state of spiritual ecstasy and give control of your body over the spirits that you commune with. For the next 10 minutes, when you make an ability check that uses your Intelligence or Wisdom, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

This state of spiritual ecstasy ends early if you enter a Rage, if you fall unconscious, or you use a bonus action on your turn to end it.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Spectral Warriors

When you Rage, the Spectral Warriors that you commune with come to your aid, and remain with you for the duration of your current Rage.

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can send these Spectral Warriors to harry that creature. Until the start of your next turn, the Spectral Warriors swirl around that creature, and it has disadvantage on any attack roll that it makes against targets other than you, and if it hits a creature other than you with an attack, its target has resistance to the damage dealt by that attack.

These Spiritual Warriors return to you if their target dies, or if your Rage ends.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Spiritual Ward

You can call on your Spectral Warriors to protect your allies. When another creature that you can see within 30 feet takes damage while you are raging, you can use a reaction to order your Spectral Warriors to intercept the attack, reducing the triggering damage by three rolls of your Exploit Die.

If your Spiritual Warriors are currently harrying an enemy when you use this reaction, the effects end for that creature.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Greater Conduit

Your ability to conduct spiritual power has grown. While you are in a state of ecstasy from Conduit of Spirits, you can cast *clairvoyance* or *commune* without expending a spell slot or material components. However, after you finish casting either of these spells, your state of spiritual ecstasy ends.

When you cast *clairvoyance* in this way, the spell summons an invisible spirit you are communed with, and when you cast *commune*, you consult your bonded spirits for information.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Vengeful Spirits

Your powerful connection to the spiritual world allows the long-dead warriors bound to you to once again strike at the living. When you use Spiritual Ward to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to the amount of damage reduced by your Spiritual Ward.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-battlerager">

## Alternate Path of the Battlerager

Reveling in the chaos of battle, the Barbarians of this Primal Path don their signature spiked armor and charge headlong into combat. Learning to channel their Rage while wearing their signature armor, these savage warriors fight as if they have no regard for their own life, only the thrill of battle.

### Level 3 - Savage Smith

You have learned the skills necessary to craft and maintain your spiked armor. You gain proficiency in smith's tools and heavy armor.

You can also Rage while you are wearing heavy armor.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Spiked Armor

Over the course of an hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use smith's tools to affix spikes to a set of non-magical armor, turning it into Spiked Armor. Spiked Armor has the following properties when worn by you:

- It is a martial melee weapon with a reach of 5 feet, and on hit, the armor deals piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier.
- While you are raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to make a single Spiked Armor attack.
- If you successfully grapple a creature it takes piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Reckless Abandon

Your bloodlust propels you into battle. While raging, the first time you make a Reckless attack on each of your turns you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. These temporary hit points vanish when your Rage ends.

In addition, you can turn magic armor into Spiked Armor.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Wild Charge

Your fury compels you to throw yourself headlong into battle. You learn the *Aggressive Sprint* exploit if you didn't know it already. While you are raging, you can use it without expending an Exploit Die. However, the attack that you make as part of this Exploit must be a Spiked Armor attack.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Spiked Retribution

When a creature hits you with a melee attack while you are raging and wearing your Spiked Armor, it instantly takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier.

If you are conscious, you can use your reaction to replace this damage with the damage of a Spiked Armor attack.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-beast">

## Alternate Path of the Beast

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.

### Level 3 - Bestial Rage

When you Rage, you manifest a portion of your bestial power in the form of one of the natural weapons listed below, which lasts for the duration of that Rage. These weapons all count as simple melee weapons which you are proficient with, and use your Strength modifier for their attack and damage rolls:

- **Bite.** You grow fangs that deal 1d8 piercing damage on hit. Once per turn when you hit a creature with this Bite, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.

- **Claws.** Your hands elongate into savage claws that deal 1d6 slashing damage on hit. Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn and make only Claw attacks, you can make one additional Claw attack as part of that Attack action.

- **Tail.** You sprout a long thick tail that deals 1d8 piercing damage on hit and has the reach property. When a creature within 10 feet that you can see targets you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to add one roll of your Exploit Die to your Armor Class against that attack.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Savage Prowess

The ancient curse that flows in your veins greatly increases your physical abilities. You gain the benefits listed below:

- You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- You learn the *Cunning Instinct* and *Mighty Leap* exploits if you didn't know them already and you can use them at will without expending an Exploit Die (as if you spent 1 Die).
- Your natural weapon attacks count as magical for overcoming resistances and immunities to non-magical attacks and damage.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Infectious Fury

When you hit a creature with a natural weapon attack while raging, you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC or suffer one of the following effects of your choice:

- The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.
- The target takes 2d12 psychic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all uses each time you finish a long rest.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Primal Roar

Your roar is fueled by the primal fury of your curse. You learn the *Roar of Triumph* exploit if you didn't know it already, and you are not limited to using it once per short or long rest, and can use it as long as you have Exploit Dice.

Moreover, while a creature has temporary hit points from *Roar of Triumph* it has advantage on the first melee weapon attack that it makes on each of its turns.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-berserker">

## Alternate Path of the Berserker

The savage warriors known as Berserkers live for the chaos of battle. For these Barbarians, their Rage is a manifestation of their lust for violence and destruction. Often found on the front lines of battle, Berserkers only feel fully alive when they are risking life and limb to test their might against their foes.

### Level 3 - Frenzy

Your fury in battle surpasses that of even other Barbarians, making you a terror to behold. The first time you hit with a Strength-based weapon attack on your turn, you deal bonus damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die.

Your fury also propels you headlong into battle. While you are raging, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Mindless Rage

You lose yourself in your wild Rage. You can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you Rage, the effect is suspended for the duration.

Moreover, while you are raging, you can ignore the effects of the first five levels of exhaustion that you have.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Intimidating Presence

Your presence inspires fear. You learn the *Menacing Shout* exploit if you didn't know it already and you can use it without expending an Exploit Die a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.

If you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on the same turn that you use *Menacing Shout*, that creature has disadvantage on its saving throw against it.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Unrivaled Fury

The fury you direct at your foes in battle is unrivaled. You learn the *Savage Rebuke* exploit if you didn't know it already and you can use it at will, without expending a Exploit Die.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-storm-herald">

## Alternate Path of the Storm Herald

Dwelling in places of great elemental power, Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald come to embody the destructive power of the elements themselves. The primal fury of their Rage turns them into walking disasters; swirling blizzards, devastating hurricanes, and sweltering storms of flame.

### Level 3 - Storm Aura

When you Rage, you emanate an Aura of primal power in a 10-foot radius, choosing Blizzard, Drought, or Hurricane for its effects. If your Aura requires a creature to make a saving throw, it does so against your Exploit save DC.

When you gain a level in this class, you can change the effect of your Aura for another option from the list below:

- **Blizzard.** Any creature of your choice that starts its turn within range has its speed halved until start of its next turn.

- **Drought.** At the end of each of your turns, creatures of your choice within range take fire damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 damage).

- **Hurricane.** At the end of each of your turns you can force one creature within range to make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes lightning damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die on a failed save, and half as much damage on a success.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Elemental Body

Your connection to the forces of nature deepens and grants you the benefits below associated with your Storm Aura:

- **Blizzard.** You gain resistance to cold damage, and when you deal damage with a Savage Exploit, you can choose for it to deal cold damage in place of its normal damage type.

- **Drought.** You gain resistance to fire damage, and you learn the *produce flame* cantrip. Constitution is your spellcasting modifier for it, and you can cast it even while you are raging.

- **Hurricane.** You gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe both air and water.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Storm Ward

Your primal power overflows and infuses your companions. While raging, creatures of your choice within your Storm Aura gain the benefits of your Elemental Body feature.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Primal Destruction

The elemental forces that fuel your Rage grows ever stronger. Your Storm Aura gains the following additional benefits:

- **Blizzard.** When a creature begins its turn within your Storm Aura, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of its next turn.

- **Drought.** When a creature within your Storm Aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes fire damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die.

- **Hurricane.** When a creature within your Storm Aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is knocked back from you 10 feet in a straight line and falls prone.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-totem-warrior">

## Alternate Path of the Totem Warrior

Barbarians who follow the Path of the Totem warrior learn to bind themselves to primal bestial spirits of the natural world. Drawing upon this animalistic power, these warriors are able to take on the spiritual and physical abilities of these bestial spirits. Totem Warriors often serve as protectors of the wilds and have a special dedication to the beasts of the wilderness.

### Level 3 - Spirit Guide

Your connection to the primal spirits of nature allows you to communicate with wild beasts. You learn the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but can only cast them as rituals.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Totemic Spirit

Choose one of the animal spirits from the list below to gain its benefits. Once selected, this choice cannot be changed:

- **Bear.** The resilient spirit of the Bear increases your ability to take physical hits. While raging, you gain resistance to all types of damage except psychic damage.

- **Eagle.** The fierce spirit of the Eagle grants you the ability to move fast as the wind. While raging, you can use a bonus action to gain the benefits of the Dash and Disengage action, including the bonus action that you use to enter a Rage.

- **Elk.** The noble spirit of the Elk makes you extraordinarily swift. While raging, your walking speed increases by 15 feet.

- **Tiger.** The ruthless spirit of the Tiger empowers your leaps in battle. You learn the *Mighty Leap* exploit if you didn't know it already. Once per turn while raging, you can use it at its lowest level without expending an Exploit Die.

- **Wolf.** The cunning spirit of the Wolf enhances your ability to fight alongside your pack. While raging, allied creatures of your choice have advantage on any melee attack roll they make against hostile creatures within 10 feet of you.

<hr>

### Level 6 - Totemic Aspect

You gain the benefits of a second animal spirit, choosing from the list below. Once selected, this choice cannot be changed:

- **Owl.** The spirit of the Owl grants you its sight. When you make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check you can add your Constitution modifier to your roll.

- **Panther.** The spirit of the Panther increases your cunning. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) or Wisdom (Survival) check you can add your Constitution modifier to your roll.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Spirit Walker

You can turn to your Totem Spirits for spiritual guidance. You learn the *commune with nature* spell, but you can only cast it as a ritual, beseeching your Totem Spirits for information.

Moreover, once per long rest, you can cast *commune with nature* and replace one of your animal Totem Spirits with another animal Totem Spirit available at the same level.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Totemic Attunement

You gain the benefits of a final animal spirit, completing your training as a Totem Warrior. Choose from the list below:

- **Lion.** The spirit of the Lion imbues you with regal power. While raging, any hostile creatures within 5 feet of you have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you.

- **Falcon.** The spirit of the Falcon grants you its wings. While raging, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

- **Rhino.** The spirit of the Rhino lends you its power. While raging, if you hit a creature that is one size larger than you or smaller with a Strength-based melee weapon attack, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-wild-magic">

## Alternate Path of the Wild Magic

For some Barbarians, their Rage boils up from an unrealized magical potential. When those born with an arcane spark fail to channel it in the correct way, this uncontrollable power can burst forth in a chaotic storm of magic-infused battle fury.

### Level 3 - Magic Awareness

As an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of spells or magic items within 60 feet that aren't behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn its school of magic.

You can use this feature once per short or long rest at no cost, after which you must expend an Exploit Die to use it.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Wild Magic

When you Rage, you roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magic effect you produce.

If a Wild Sorcery effect requires a saving throw, targets make their saving throws against your Exploit save DC.

| d20 | Wild Magic Effect |
|:---:|:---:|
| 01  | Creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die. You then gain temporary hit points equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die + your level. |
| 02  | You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. |
| 03  | An orb of wild magic explodes at a point that you can see within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to your Exploit Die. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use a bonus action to cause this effect to happen again. |
| 04  | Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that you are holding. Until your current Rage, the weapon's damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the magic weapon leaves your hand, it appears in your hand at the end of your turn. |
| 05  | Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before the end of your current Rage, it takes force damage equal to your Exploit Die, as magic lashes out in retribution. |
| 06  | Until the end of your current Rage, you are surrounded by multicolored, protective lights; you, and allied creatures within 10 feet of you, all gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. |
| 07  | Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you; until the end of your current Rage, the ground within 15 feet of you is considered difficult terrain for creatures of your choice. |
| 08  | Roll another d20. On an even roll, your size grows by one category as if by the *enlarge* part of the *enlarge/reduce* spell. On an odd roll, your size is reduced by one category as if by the reduce part of the enlarge/reduce spell. |
| 09  | You can't speak for the duration of your current Rage. If you try, a small bird flies out of your mouth and toward the sun. |
| 10  | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space. |
| 11  | For the duration of your current Rage, you gain resistance to the last instance of damage you took, until you take another instance of damage. For example, if you take fire damage from a red dragon's fire breath, you are resistant to fire damage until you take another type of damage. |
| 12  | For the duration of your current Rage, every hair on your body grows by one foot at the end of each of your turns. When your current Rage ends, all of your hair falls out. |
| 13  | A bolt of radiant light shoots from your chest. A creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take radiant damage equal to your Exploit Die and be blinded until the start of your next turn. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. |
| 14  | For the duration of your current Rage, you can walk through solid objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your movement inside a creature or object, you are instantly shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for each 5 feet that you were forced to travel. |
| 15  | Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older. |
| 16  | For the duration of your current Rage, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried, instantly bursts into flame. |
| 17  | Your limbs grow strangely long. For the duration of your current Rage, the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet. |
| 18  | Your muscles are engorged with wild magic. For the duration of your current Rage, all creatures have disadvantage on any saving throws to resist the effects of your Exploits. |
| 19  | For the duration of your current Rage, the distance of your long and high jumps is tripled, even if this extra distance would exceed your remaining movement. |
| 20  | You instantly regain all expended uses of your Rage. |

<hr>

### Level 6 - Sorcerous Infusion

As an action, you can touch a creature, including yourself, and confer one of the following benefits to that creature:

- Choose an ability score. For 10 minutes, when the target makes an ability check or saving throw with that ability score, it gains a bonus to its roll equal to your Exploit Die.
- The creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Exploit Die. For as long as the temporary hit points last, the target is immune to Wild Sorcery effects.
- You touch a target and expend any number of Exploit Dice. The target regains an expended spell slot of a level equal to the number of Exploit Dice you expend.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses each time you finish a long rest.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Unstable Sorcery

Your unpredictable magic lashes out to protect you. When you take damage or fail a saving throw while raging, you can use a reaction to immediately roll on the Wild Magic table.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Sorcerous Warrior

Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll twice and choose the magical result that takes place.

<hr>

</div>

<div class="subclass-content" data-subclass="alt-zealot">

## Alternate Path of the Zealot

Your Rage has been implanted in you by the divine powers of the heavens. Whether you are the descendant of a powerful celestial, or the chosen champion of a deity, you now carry in you a spark of divine wrath. Those who walk the Path of the Zealot stand as champions of the gods and divine causes.

### Level 3 - Champion of the Gods

You have been chosen for a divine purpose. Spellcasters can cast spells that restore you to life (not undeath) such as *raise dead*, without needing the normal material components.

<hr>

### Level 3 - Divine Fury

Your weapon strikes are imbued with the celestial power of the god you serve. While you are raging, the first creature you hit with a weapon attack on each of your turns takes bonus damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

The type of this bonus damage changes depending on your alignment: Good (radiant), Neutral (thunder), Evil (necrotic).

<hr>

### Level 6 - Fanatical Focus

Your divine cause propels you to find success when others would fail. When you fail a saving throw while raging, you can expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your saving throw, possibly turning a failure into a success.

<hr>

### Level 10 - Divine Mandate

As a bonus action on your turn, you can issue a divine battle cry to your allies. Up to 10 creatures that can hear you within 60 feet have advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws until the beginning of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

<hr>

### Level 14 - Rage Beyond Death

The gods will not allow you to die while you still serve them. Being reduced to 0 hit points while raging doesn’t knock you unconscious. While in this state, you still make death saving throws as normal, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. If you start your turn with three failed death saving throws you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain your Rage.

If your Rage ends and you still have 0 hit points, you fall unconscious. If you have three failed death saves, you die.

<hr>
