If the creature lands in an unoccupied space, it falls prone. If it hits another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier.

If a feature causes you to count as a size larger for your carrying capacity or the size of creatures you can grapple, you also count as one size larger for the creatures you can throw.

#### Honor Duel
*Prerequisites: 5th level*

As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die and shout a challenge at a foe. One creature of your choice within 30 feet that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls it makes against targets other than you for 1 minute.

The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This effect ends early if you attack a creature other than the target.

#### Immovable Stance
*Prerequisites: 5th level, Strength or Constitution of 13*

As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to enter an immovable stance that lasts until you move from the space. Each time a creature attempts to grapple you, move you against your will, or move through your space while you are in this stance, it must first succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can instantly grapple it or knock it prone.

#### Intimidating Command
*Prerequisites: 5th level, Charisma of 13*

As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to shout a one-word command at one creature that can hear you within 30 feet.

The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.

#### Shattering Slam
*Prerequisites: 5th level, Strength of 13*

In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike the ground at your feet with a melee weapon.

#### Confounding Critical
*Prerequisites: 9th level, Strength of 15*

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to strike at the head, weakening its ability to think. For 1 minute, its thoughts are muddled and whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration, it must roll a d6 and subtract the result from its roll.

The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.

#### Destructive Slam
*Prerequisites: 9th level, Strength of 15*

In place of an attack, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and strike the ground at your feet, forcing all creatures in an adjacent 20-foot cube to make a Dexterity saving throw.

On a success, they take half as much damage and don't fall prone. Objects in this area take the maximum amount of damage.

- Your walking speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Strength modifier (minimum of 5 feet).
- You count as one size larger for the purposes of carrying capacity and the size of creatures that you can grapple.

The effects last for 10 minutes for each Exploit Die spent as part of this Exploit, and end early if you are incapacitated.

#### Mythic Resilience
*Prerequisites: 9th level, Constitution of 15*

When you take damage from an effect you can see, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to reduce the incoming damage. For each Exploit Die you expend, roll three Exploit Dice, adding your Constitution modifier to the total of all the dice. You reduce the damage by the total.

If the total rolled exceeds the amount of damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to the remaining amount.

#### Pack Tactics
*Prerequisites: 9th level, Wisdom of 15*

As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die to signal your allies to fight as a pack. Until the end of your next turn, creatures of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet have advantage on attack rolls, so long as a conscious allied creature is within 5 feet of their target.

You can use a bonus action on your next turn to extend the effects of this Exploit to the end of the turn after that, though you do not need to expend an Exploit Die when you do so.

You cannot maintain this Exploit longer than 1 minute.

#### Primal Terror
*Prerequisite: 9th level*

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die to attempt to drive a creature within 5 feet into a fit of primal fear, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures as enemies for the next minute.

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target of an attack or spell, it must choose its target at random from among the creatures it can see within range.

If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, it must make that attack if it is able to.

#### Roar of Triumph
*Prerequisites: 9th level*

When you score a critical hit, you can expend an Exploit Die to let out a cry that can be heard up to 300 feet away. You and a number of creatures of your choice who can hear you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier.

#### Savage Defiance
*Prerequisites: 9th level*

#### Survey Wilderness
*Prerequisite: 9th level, Strength or Wisdom of 15*

You can expend an Exploit Die and spend 1 hour gathering information on up to 1 square mile of a wilderness that you currently occupy. At the end of the hour, you gain knowledge about three of the following as they relate to the area:

- Any settlements or camps with five or more occupants.
- Prominent natural formations, bodies of water, and ruins.
- Local plants, animals, weather, and ecosystems.
- Powerful (CR 1 or higher) creatures that reside within, or have passed through the area within the last 24 hours.

#### War Cry
*Prerequisites: 9th level*

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and issue a mighty cry, forcing creatures of your choice that can hear you in an adjacent 30-foot cone to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they drop whatever they are holding and are frightened of you for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn and does not have line of sight to you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

</div>

<div class="exploit-content" data-exploit="exploit_degree4">

### 4th-Degree Exploits

Exploits of this degree can only be learned by Barbarians of 13th level or higher, and each 4th-degree Exploit that you know can only be used once per short or long rest.

#### Devastating Critical
*Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to shatter its focus. If it was concentrating on a spell or effect, it automatically loses concentration, and for 1 minute, it has disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, and any saving throws it makes to maintain concentration.

The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.

### Staggering Blow
*#Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or for the next minute it has disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls and it cannot take reactions.

The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending these effects on a success.

#### Strength of the Colossus
*Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*

As a bonus action you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to enhance your strength to mythic levels, though you must concentrate on this Exploit's effect as if you were concentrating on a spell. For 10 minutes, or until you lose concentration, the amount of weight you can push, drag, pull, or lift is multiplied by the amount in the table below:

| Exploit Dice | Total Weight |
|--------------|--------------|
| 1            | 50 x Strength score |
| 2            | 100 x Strength score |
| 3            | 150 x Strength score |
| 4            | 200 x Strength score |
| 5            | 250 x Strength score |
| 6            | 300 x Strength score |

For each size category you are above Medium, the amount of weight you can move as part of this Exploit is doubled.

For example, a Medium-sized Barbarian with 20 Strength could expend 3 Exploit Dice to use this Exploit, multiplying their 20 Strength by 150, to lift up to 3,000 pounds. If they were Large, they would double this weight to 6,000 pounds.

When this Exploit ends you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer a number of levels of exhaustion equal to the number of Exploit Dice you spent.

#### Subjugate Beast
*Prerequisites: 13th level*

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and attempt to intimidate one beast that can see or hear you within 30 feet, bending it to your will. The beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be considered charmed by you for 1 minute.

While it is charmed, you can use a bonus action to issue it a command, which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action. If it doesn’t receive direction from you, it defends itself to the best of its ability.

Each time the beast takes damage, it repeats the saving throw, ending the effects of this Exploit on a success.

#### Sundering Strike
*Prerequisites: 13th level, Strength of 17*

In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike a creation of magical force, such as a prismatic wall, resilient sphere, or forcecage with a melee weapon you are wielding. Any magical creations created with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower are instantly destroyed by your strike.

If the magical creation was created with a spell of 4th-level or higher, make a Strength check. The DC equals 10 + the level of the spell slot used to create it. On a successful check, the magical creation is instantly destroyed by your strike.

#### Unbreakable
*Prerequisites: 13th level, Constitution of 17*

When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, even if that damage would kill you outright, you can spend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and fall to 1 hit point. For each Exploit Die you spent, you roll three Exploit Dice, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.

</div>

<div class="exploit-content" data-exploit="exploit_degree5">

### 5th-Degree Exploits

Exploits of the fifth degree are feats of savage skill that rival those of great monsters. These Exploits can only be learned by Barbarians of 17th level or higher, and each 5th-degree Exploit can only be used once per long rest.

#### Banishing Strike
*Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike with legendary power, dealing bonus force damage equal to four rolls of your Exploit Die. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or be shunted to a harmless demiplane where it is incapacitated. At the start of your next turn it reappears in the unoccupied space nearest to the last space it occupied when you hit it with this attack.

#### Cataclysmic Slam
*Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*

As an action on your turn, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to strike the ground with mythic power. A shockwave of thunderous force erupts from you, forcing all creatures within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take bludgeoning damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent + your Strength modifier and are knocked prone, and on a success, they take half as much damage and don't fall prone. Objects in this area take maximum damage.

The area becomes difficult terrain, and a creature can use its action to clear one 5-foot square of this difficult terrain.

#### Vorpal Critical
*Prerequisites: 17th level, Strength of 19*

When you score a critical hit with a melee attack on a creature, you can expend one Exploit Die to strike with brutal legendary force and deal additional damage equal to three rolls of your Exploit Die.

If the damage of this Exploit reduces the target's remaining hit points to 50 or fewer, you instantly cut off one of its heads. If it can't survive without that head, it is killed.

Creatures can use Legendary Resistance to avoid being beheaded. Any creatures that don't have or don't need a head are immune to this Exploit's effects, but still take the additional damage on hit.
